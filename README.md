# Symbiz
A minimal online store application built to understand Play Framework.
The project allows users to buy products and also sell the products. Before buying and selling the products the user must register on the platform.

Note- This application was developed in 2015 on Play 2.2.2, and therefore a lot of this code might be deprecated now.
